## About this project
I'm a former Japanese translator and programmer studying for the JLPT N1. I started Manjidict about two weeks ago as of 01/11/2023. I've been making changes off and on all day while playing various games and reading in Japanese. I expect this trend to continue for the forseeable future, so expect the program to change quite a bit over time. This project will continue daily development until every feature is as good or better than that of competing alternatives. Currently, JGlossator still comes out ahead when parsing complex morphological structures, but Manjidict has features such as Google Translate support which are not present in JGlossator. Getting parsing down is my main concern right now and should all fit into place in the coming days or weeks. I decided to go ahead and open this project up because it is finally in a state that I can reasonably describe it as a solid alternative. I hope you stick with this application while it continues to grow. Thanks!
